Component: Task 1-5

### Comments 

Given how this group assignment turned solo not too long ago, I am very stressed and the jar file that I made does not run
As a result of this, I would like to comment on a few pieces of code that I have written.
I would just like to say that the best pieces ofall tasks this means Tasks 1-5 is 
the well commented lines of code. Although the code may seem messy and theNameTypes
e.g. (int z = , int s =) aren't clear sometimes all the code is clearly commented on
allowing for anyone looking at the code to understand what the variable is.
The naming of the code in this however, is not too good. I would like to improve on my naming
This means that I have to stop naming things z or s and name things stuff like 'spine' or 'getSpine'
I have demonstrated this improvement a bit in the helper that I have started writing in Task 5.
Moving on the methods and classes. I feel like all methods and classes are appropriate with no wasted space. All methods are
clearly labelled and all classes contain useful infromation that relate to the whole game.
All in all I think the code is commented neatly and the methods and classes are well sorted.
But I feel like the naming of types such as ints and chars can be improved upon.
